Create a simple String calculator with a method void Add(). The calculator reads a line from some input and writes it to some output.
- The input could be System.in or a web service.
- The output could be System.out or a web service.

The method can take 0, 1 or 2 numbers, and will print their sum (for an empty string it will print 0) for example “” or “1” or “1,2”
