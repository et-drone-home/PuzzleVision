# Subscription Renewal Kata

You just got a new job at a Magazine. The CEO tells you that they're losing a lot of business, and they're pretty sure it’s because people aren't checking their mailboxes for renewal forms anymore.
His solution? Use email instead! He asks you to write a program that will email his subscribers that have not paid for three months the message "Please renew your subscription to Ferret Fancy!"

You quickly run into two problems:
  1. the CEO hired someone else to write the email connector for the application. The fellow promises "it will be done when it’s done!" and is no longer answering your calls.
  2. Also, the real subscriber service appears to be unreliable and will sometimes drop its connection.


## Requirements
Using test doubles and TDD, make sure that your program will be able to handle as many situations as these two services can possibly throw at it.
